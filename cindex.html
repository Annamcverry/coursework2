      <h1>How To Dynamically Create HTML From JS</h1>
      <p>HTML can be rendered <em>Statically</em> or <em>Dynamically</em>.</p>
      <h2>Static</h2>
      <p>
        This means that no matter what happens on the page, each time the
        browser renders this HTML page it will always display the same.
      </p>

      <h2>Dynamically</h2>
      <p>
        This means that what has rendered on the page might differ dependant on
        different scenarios. IE, in your case, when a user selects a different
        price or location.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >See below the image which we are going to render both static and
          dynamically.</em
        >
      </p>
      <img class="mockup" src="./mockup.png" alt="pic of spain" />

      <h3>Static Rendering</h3>
      <p>
        This below element has been created using HTML alone and if you wanted
        to create multiple listings we would need to copy and paste the code
        countless times and manually change all the content of each listing.
        Another downside to this is if we wanted to add say a third item to the
        listing EG:<em>Has Wifi: Yes/No</em>, we will now need to go into every
        HTML item that we have and manually add it. This can be a pain if we
        have 5+ items to add it to...
      </p>
      <!-- JS Reference #3: -->
      <div class="row tile">
        <div class="col-4 tile-img"></div>
        <div class="col-8 tile-body">
          <!-- JS Reference #4: -->
          <h4>Spain</h4>
          <h4 class="tile-price">Price: Â£100/day</h4>
          <p>People: 2</p>
          <p>House Type: Apartment</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Dynamic Rendering</h3>
      <p>
        This method utilises JavaScript such that we create the CSS for each
        item using class names and assign them to the elements when they are
        created in JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look to the JS file I have supplied to follow along with how this has
        been done, I have included comments and steps so it can be followed in
        logical order.
      </p>

      <!-- This is the JavaScript root element that we are targeting -->
      <div id="root-contianer"></div>
      <p>
        The tiles above here have been rendered using JavaScript, you can see in
        the HTML that there is nothing here but the tiles are here.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic Rendering Based on Data</h3>

      <button id="loader">Click me to load dynamic content.</button>
      <div id="data-root-container"></div>
    </div>
